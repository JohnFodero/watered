# Task 5: Admin Panel

## Objective
Create an admin interface for managing application configuration and user access.

## Requirements
- [ ] Create admin authentication middleware
- [ ] Design admin panel UI with Alpine.js
- [ ] Implement timeout configuration management
- [ ] Add email whitelist management interface
- [ ] Create user management functionality
- [ ] Add admin API endpoints
- [ ] Implement admin-only route protection

## Admin Features
- [ ] View current plant state and history
- [ ] Modify watering timeout settings
- [ ] Add/remove emails from whitelist
- [ ] View user activity logs
- [ ] System configuration management
- [ ] Export plant watering history

## API Endpoints
- `GET /admin/config` - Get current configuration
- `PUT /admin/config/timeout` - Update watering timeout
- `GET /admin/users` - List whitelisted users
- `POST /admin/users` - Add user to whitelist
- `DELETE /admin/users/:email` - Remove user from whitelist
- `GET /admin/history` - Get plant watering history
- `GET /admin/stats` - Get usage statistics

## Admin UI Components
- [ ] Configuration dashboard
- [ ] User management table
- [ ] Plant history timeline
- [ ] System status indicators
- [ ] Form validation and error handling

## Security Considerations
- [ ] Admin role verification
- [ ] Action logging for audit trail
- [ ] Rate limiting on admin endpoints
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization

## Success Criteria
- Admin can modify all configuration settings
- Changes are persisted and applied immediately
- Admin interface is intuitive and responsive
- All admin actions are properly logged
- Non-admin users cannot access admin features

## Next Steps
- Task 6: Docker configuration
- Task 7: Testing and deployment
