# Task 7: Testing and Deployment

## Objective
Implement comprehensive testing and prepare for deployment.

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for all business logic
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Authentication flow testing
- [ ] Database operation testing
- [ ] Error handling and edge case testing

## Test Structure
```

├── unit/           # Unit tests for individual functions
├── integration/    # API endpoint tests
├── e2e/           # End-to-end user flow tests
└── fixtures/      # Test data and mocks
```

## Testing Tools
- Go standard `testing` package
- `testify` for assertions and mocks
- `httptest` for HTTP handler testing
- Test database with cleanup utilities

## Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline configuration
- [ ] Document production deployment steps

- [ ] Database migrations ready
- [ ] SSL certificates configured
- [ ] Backup strategy implemented
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards set up
- [ ] Log aggregation configured

## Performance Considerations
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Static asset caching
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Response time optimization

## Security Checklist
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Input validation comprehensive
- [ ] Authentication flows secure
- [ ] Session management hardened
- [ ] Dependency security scanning

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass consistently
- Code coverage above 80%
