# Development Tasks

This directory contains task files that guide the development of the Watered plant tracking application. Each task file represents a development phase with specific requirements and success criteria.

## Task Overview

1. **01-backend-setup.md** - Initialize Go backend with project structure
2. **02-frontend-setup.md** - Create frontend with Alpine.js and plant visualization
3. **03-google-sso.md** - Implement Google OAuth2 authentication
4. **04-plant-api.md** - Build plant state management API
5. **05-admin-panel.md** - Create admin interface for configuration
6. **06-docker-setup.md** - Configure Docker for development and production
7. **07-testing-deployment.md** - Implement testing and deployment procedures

## How to Use These Tasks

1. **Sequential Development**: Tasks are designed to be completed in order, as later tasks depend on earlier ones.

2. **Feature-by-Feature**: Each task represents a complete feature that can be tested independently.

3. **Checkboxes**: Use the checkboxes in each task file to track progress.

4. **Iterative Improvement**: Tasks can be revisited to add complexity or refine implementation.

## Development Principles

- **Simple First**: Start with basic implementations, add complexity later
- **Test Everything**: Write tests for all functionality as you build
- **Document Well**: Keep documentation updated as features are added
- **Learn by Doing**: Focus on understanding Go and frontend development concepts

## Getting Started

Begin with Task 1 (backend setup) and work through each task sequentially. Refer to the main CLAUDE.md file for overall project architecture and coding guidelines.
